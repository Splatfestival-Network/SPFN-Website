                <h2>Installation - Wii U</h2>
                <p>Requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wii U with Aroma</li>
                    <li>SD Card (Preferrably 32GB)</li>
                    <li>Computer or other device to access SD Card</li>
                    <li>An internet connection</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Ensure that you don't have a default user set before setting up SPFN as it could cause you to log in with the wrong account.
                    To disable it, turn on your Wii U and when it logs in, press your Mii in the top left and scroll down to the option labelled "Default User" and disable it.
                </p>
                <p>If you are currently using Pretendo's DNS servers to connect to Pretendo, disable the DNS server before continuing.</p>
                <h3>Step 1 - SD Card Preparation</h3>
                <p>Plug your SD card into your computer and navigate to <strong class="filepath">SD:/wiiu/environments</strong></p>
                <p>Make a copy of your <strong class="filepath">aroma</strong> environment folder and rename it to <strong class="filepath">SPFN</strong> - this will be the environment you use for connecting to our servers.</p>
                <p>For users who previously used Pretendo's Inkay plugin, delete the files <strong class="filepath">plugins/inkay-pretendo.wps</strong> and <strong class="filepath">modules/inkay-pretendo.wms</strong> from the SPFN environment.</p>
                <p>Download the plugins and modules found here (LINK NOT AVAILABLE) - make sure you enable file name extensions in your file browser and take note of the extension.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong class="filepath">plugin.wps</strong> goes into <strong class="filepath">plugins</strong></li>
                    <li><strong class="filepath">module.wms</strong> goes into <strong class="filepath">modules</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>With these files installed, you can eject your SD card and put it into your Wii U.</p>

                <h3>Step 2 - Setup on Console</h3>
                <p>Power on the console and hold X on the gamepad to open the Environment Loader.</p>
                <p>Navigate using the D-Pad to <strong class="filepath">SPFN</strong> and press A to select. Your console will now be connected to our servers.</p>
                <p>
                    In the top left of your screen, you should see a message saying "Connected to Servers". 
                    If you see "Using Pretendo Network", DO NOT PROGRESS.
                    Turn off the console and delete the Pretendo plugins as mentioned in step 1.
                    If you do not see the "Connected to Servers" message, you likely didn't install the plugin correctly.
                    Check the locations of the <strong class="filepath">plugin.wps</strong> and <strong class="filepath">module.wms</strong> files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    SPFN's servers are separate from both Nintendo and Pretendo, so you will need to create a new account to access our services.
                    Now that your console is connected to our servers, you should be brought to the accounts page Press <strong class="filepath">+</strong> on your gamepad to create a new account.
                    Follow the process of creating the account. Select no when prompted if you have an NNID. Select a Mii for your account. When asked to create an account, press <strong class="filepath">Link</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>Before continuing, confirm that the guide references Splatfestival Network. If it does not, your plugins aren't set up correctly. Return to step 1 and ensure they are correctly placed.</p>
                <p>If it does reference Splatfestival Network, read through the agreement and press <strong class="filepath">Agree</strong> and enter your account information.</p>
                <p>DO NOT REUSE PASSWORDS ACROSS MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF OUR NETWORK</p>
                <p>
                    Once you have created your account, you will be sent a verification code to your registered email address.
                    To enter it, log into your account on your Wii U and it will prompt you for the code.
                    If you are already logged in, press on your Mii in the top left of your gamepad and select Switch User. Then, select your SPFN account to log back in.
                </p>
                <p>Open Splatoon and check that you get the news.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: Dump Necessary Files</h3>
                <p>
                    This guide requires that you have alredy set up SPFN on your Wii U and created an account.
                    Account creation is currently unavailable on this website.
                    If you have not done this yet, <a href="#" onclick="changeGuide('g-install')">follow this guide first.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will also need to dump your SPFN account and <strong class="filepath">otp.bin</strong> and <strong class="filepath">seeprom.bin</strong> files from your Wii U.
                    Follow Cemu's <a href="https://cemu.cfw.guide/using-dumpling.html#online-files" target="_blank">guide to dump online files</a> to dump your SPFN account.
                    Take this time to also dump your Splatoon game and the latest update if you haven't already done so.
                </p>
                <p>Transfer the dumped files to your computer.</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Cemu Configuration</h3>
                <p>Make sure you are using the latest version of Cemu. This can be found <a href="https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases" target="_blank">here</a></p>
                <p>Open Cemu and go to File -> Open Cemu Folder. Place the dumped <strong class="filepath">mlc01</strong> folder into the Cemu folder.</p>
                <p>Download the following file: network_services.xml (LINK NOT AVAILABLE) and place it into the root of the Cemu folder</p>
                <p>
                    Open Cemu and go to Options -> General Settings.
                    In the Account tab, make sure your SPFN account is selected.
                    If not, select it from the dropdown.
                    You should see the option to switch to Custom network services. Select this.
                    If you can't select it, you haven't added the network_services.xml file correctly.
                </p>
                <p>Open Splatoon and check that you get the news.</p>

                <h2>Troubleshooting - Wii U</h2>
                <h3>I'm getting error code 118-XXXX when joining Splatoon matches</h3>
                <p>
                    Error codes starting with 118 refer to the Peer to Peer connection.
                    Either your connection or the connection of the host console is bad, resulting in errors like this.
                    Ensure that your NAT type is either A or B (preferrably A) and try again.
                </p>
                <h3>I'm getting error code 616-XXXX when booting into the SPFN environment</h3>
                <p>SPFN requires you to be on the latest version of Aroma. Open the Aroma Updater while in the SPFN environment and update it.</p>
